## Automated Docker Image Builds 🛠️  

This repository is configured to **automatically build Docker images** and **push them to Docker Hub**. 🎉  

Here’s how it works:  

1. Code is pushed to the `main` branch.  
2. A GitHub Action workflow is triggered, building the Docker image.  
3. The built image is tagged and pushed to the [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/abhiverma001).
